Here's a professional `README.md` file tailored for your **Recommendation API Project**, incorporating everything we've discussed—FastAPI, the structure, the POST endpoint that receives user data and returns a recommended number of questions per topic and level.

# Recommendation API

This project is a structured and scalable **Recommendation System API** built using **FastAPI**. It is designed to dynamically allocate a number of practice questions per topic and level based on user progress and available questions, ensuring a personalized and adaptive learning experience.

## Features

- Built with **FastAPI** for high performance and easy development.
- Receives structured JSON input representing user ID, question availability, and progress.
- Returns a recommendation on how many questions to assign per topic and level.
- Modular codebase organized into `src/`, `utils/`, and `main.py`.
- Easily extendable for additional logic, persistence layers, or integration with frontend systems.

## API Endpoint

### POST `/recommend`

Accepts a JSON body containing the following structure:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user123",
  "total_questions": 15,
  "user_topics": {
    "math": {
      "easy": 10,
      "medium": 5,
      "hard": 2
    },
    "physics": {
      "easy": 6,
      "medium": 3,
      "hard": 1
    }
  },
  "user_progress": {
    "math": {
      "easy": 4,
      "medium": 2,
      "hard": 0
    },
    "physics": {
      "easy": 2,
      "medium": 1,
      "hard": 0
    }
  }
}
````

### Response

Returns a JSON object containing the recommended number of questions per topic and level:

```json
{
  "recommendation": {
    "math": {
      "easy": 5,
      "medium": 3,
      "hard": 2
    },
    "physics": {
      "easy": 3,
      "medium": 1,
      "hard": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The logic takes into account both the available question count and how much the user has already progressed in each area to provide a balanced allocation.

## Development

### Run the API

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Setup

If using a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```
